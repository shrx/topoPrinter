# Image Notes

This folder holds screenshots referenced by the README.

- `Alti3D_RegionSelection.png`: SwissTopo swissALTI3D download interface used to define the DEM input region. A rectangular bounding box is specified using LV95 coordinates: West = 2656000, East = 2696000, South = 1200000, North = 1220000. Resolution is set to 2.0 meters, format is Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF, coordinate system is LV95, time status = Current. The green rectangle over the map indicates the selected area to be downloaded as multiple DEM tiles. This screenshot defines the geographic extent, resolution, CRS, and data source used as input for the terrain-to-STL pipeline.
- `BlenderRender_Rigi_40x20.png`: Blender 5.0 viewport showing the final 3D-printable terrain model generated from swissALTI3D data. The mesh represents a rectangular geographic area (~40 × 20 km) converted into a solid, watertight relief block. Top surface is terrain elevation (mountains, valleys, lakes visible as flat blue regions). Bottom is a flat base; vertical sidewalls close the mesh, making it suitable for STL export and 3D printing. Z axis corresponds to elevation; X/Y correspond to Swiss projected coordinates (LV95) mapped to planar dimensions. This screenshot illustrates the expected end result after DEM mosaicking, height scaling, mesh generation, and base extrusion.
- `PrintedReliefBlock_PhysicalOutput.jpeg`: Photograph of the physical 3D-printed terrain relief produced by the pipeline. The object is a single-piece, watertight print with a flat base and vertical sidewalls. Top surface shows terrain elevation derived from swissALTI3D DEM data; fine contour-like stepping reflects layer-by-layer FDM printing. Horizontal dimensions correspond to the selected geographic bounding box; vertical dimension encodes elevation after Z-scaling. This image demonstrates the real-world output fidelity, printability, and structural correctness of the generated STL.
